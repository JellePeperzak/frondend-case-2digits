HOW TO USE THE PREPR API
- It seems that I can build queries by defining them in .graphql files in server\prepr\schemas
- Every query in such a .graphql file is named by assigning a name after 'query'.
    - e.g. the query below is called Example.
        query Example {
            Page(slug: "/") {
                page_header {
                    title
                }
            }
        }

- These queries can be accessed in a .tsx file by importing PreprSdk, using the code:
    - import { PreprSdk } from '@/server/prepr';
- Then, within the page function, you can assign the query result to a variable:
    - e.g. const { Page } = await PreprSdk.Example();
- MAKE SURE THAT THE PAGE FUNCTION IS AN ASYNC FUNCTION
    - e.g. export default async function Home() 

- Finally, the query results can be accessed by using the relevant properties of the variable 
that stores them.
    - e.g. {Page?.page_header?.title}
