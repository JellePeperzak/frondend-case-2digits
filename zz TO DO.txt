--- TO DO BEFORE HANDIN ---
    - Update banner images by using <Image> element like in the BlogCard component
        so that you have control over the formatting of the image.
    - Implement on-click in hamburger menu so that if a link is clicked, the drop-down goes away.
    - Blog navigation button navigates to /blog/blog, /blog/terms-and-conditions, etc. from an individual blog page
